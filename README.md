# stock-price-prediction-model
This stock market prediction makes use of machine learning and a linear regression model. 
This repository contains a stock prediction model that utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically a linear regression model, to forecast stock market trends. Any CSV Stock File will do as long as it has dates and your desired projection. I made use of an Apple file from Kaggle.

# Stock Prediction Model

This repository contains a stock prediction model that utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically a linear regression model, to forecast stock market trends. The model takes as input a CSV stock file with dates and the desired projection, and it has been trained and tested using an Apple stock file obtained from Kaggle.

## Motivation

Predicting stock market movements is a challenging and crucial task for investors, traders, and financial analysts. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can analyze historical stock data and identify patterns and trends that can assist in making informed investment decisions. This repository aims to provide a reliable and customizable stock prediction model that can be applied to various stock market datasets.

## Features

- **Machine Learning**: The stock prediction model is built using machine learning techniques, specifically a linear regression model. Linear regression is a widely used algorithm for predicting numerical values based on historical data.

- **CSV Stock File**: The model accepts a CSV stock file as input. The file should contain the necessary columns, such as dates and the desired projection, to train and test the model accurately. For convenience, an Apple stock file from Kaggle has been included in this repository.

- **Customizability**: The model can be easily customized to work with different stock datasets by providing the appropriate CSV file. Users can experiment with various features, such as adding technical indicators or incorporating additional data, to enhance the predictive power of the model.

## Usage

To use the stock prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/durgeshsahu16/stock-price-prediction-model.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place your CSV stock file in the repository's root directory, ensuring it contains the necessary columns (dates and the desired projection).

4. Run the model:

```
python predict_stock.py --csv_file <your_csv_file>
```

Replace `<your_csv_file>` with the name of your CSV stock file.

5. The model will train on the historical data and generate predictions for the desired projection. The results will be displayed and saved in a file for further analysis.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your requirements.

## Dataset

The dataset used to train and test the stock prediction model is an Apple stock file obtained from Kaggle. The file contains historical stock data, including dates and closing prices. By default, the model is configured to work with this dataset, but you can replace it with your own CSV stock file.

## Contribution

Contributions to the stock prediction model are welcome! If you have any ideas, bug fixes, or improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the capabilities and accuracy of the model.
